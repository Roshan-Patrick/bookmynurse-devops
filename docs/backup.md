## üöÄ OpenTofu Configuration for Full-Stack Application

**Date:** Recent conversation with AI Assistant  
**Topic:** Infrastructure as Code for Angular + Node.js + MySQL deployment

### **Complete Conversation:**

#### **Question 1: What are resources on OpenTofu config?**

**You asked:** "What are resources on Opentofu config?"

**AI Response:** 
- Resources are representations of actual infrastructure components you can create
- Example: AWS S3 bucket resource creates an actual bucket within AWS S3
- Defined using the `resource` keyword followed by type and name
- Can represent storage buckets, databases, virtual machines, etc.

**Key Points:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "website" {
  bucket = "${var.bucket_name_prefix}-${var.website_domain_name}"
  # ... other configuration
}
```

#### **Question 2: Should I define Node.js and MySQL as resources?**

**You asked:** "So if I have backend application like Node JS and MySQL Database for a Fullstack application I should define it on this resources?"

**AI Response:**
- **Yes**, you should define both Node.js and MySQL as resources
- Provided example configuration:

```hcl
# Node.js Server Resource
resource "aws_instance" "nodejs_server" {
  ami = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "NodeJS Server"
  }
}

# MySQL Database Resource
resource "aws_db_instance" "mysql_db" {
  allocated_storage = 20
  engine = "mysql"
  instance_class = "db.t2.micro"
  name = "mydatabase"
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  parameter_group_name = "default.mysql5.7"
}
```

#### **Question 3: Is Kubernetes needed?**

**You asked:** "So Kubernetes is not needed for deploying my full stack application which has angular,NodeJS and MySQL database?"

**AI Response:**
- **No, Kubernetes is not required** for this course
- The instructor focuses on Docker + Docker Compose for containerization
- OpenTofu for infrastructure as code
- These tools are sufficient for deployment

#### **Question 4: How to configure Angular application?**

**You asked:** "How to configure my Angular application on this OpenTofu config?"

**AI Response:** Provided complete S3 configuration:

```hcl
# Create S3 Bucket for Angular App
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "angular_app" {
  bucket = "your-angular-app-bucket"
  acl = "public-read"
}

# Configure Bucket for Website Hosting
resource "aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration" "angular_app" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.angular_app.id
  
  index_document {
    suffix = "index.html"
  }
  
  error_document {
    key = "error.html"
  }
}

# Upload Angular Build Files
resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "angular_app_files" {
  for_each = fileset("path/to/your/angular/dist", "**")
  
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.angular_app.bucket
  key    = each.value
  source = "path/to/your/angular/dist/${each.value}"
  acl    = "public-read"
}

# Output the Website URL
output "angular_app_url" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration.angular_app.website_endpoint
}
```

#### **Question 5: Complete OpenTofu config for full stack?**

**You asked:** "Can you send all the OpenTofu config file for my full stack application please? Angular NodeJS and MySQL database in which I have database dump which has the database name tables and values"

**AI Response:**
- The course doesn't provide specific configs for different tech stacks
- Suggested adapting course concepts to your stack
- Recommended additional courses: "Learning Terraform" and "Advanced Terraform"

#### **Question 6: What variables to set?**

**You asked:** "What variables do I have to set for my full stack application on OpenTofu config?"

**AI Response:** Listed three types of variables:

1. **Variables** (using `variable` keyword):
```hcl
variable "website_domain_name" {
  description = "The domain name for the website"
  default = "explorecalifornia.org"
}
```

2. **Local Variables** (using `locals` block):
```hcl
locals {
  mime_types = {
    "html" = "text/html"
    "css" = "text/css"
  }
}
```

3. **Environment Variables** (for running applications):
```ruby
ENV['WEBSITE_URL']
```

#### **Question 7: What local variables to set?**

**You asked:** "What local variables do I have to set for my full stack application on OpenTofu config?"

**AI Response:** Provided example local variables:

```hcl
locals {
  db_config = {
    host = "db.example.com"
    port = 5432
    username = "dbuser"
    password = "securepassword"
  }
  
  api_endpoints = {
    user_service = "https://api.example.com/users"
    order_service = "https://api.example.com/orders"
  }
}
```

## üê≥ Kubernetes Deployment Journey

**Date:** July-August 2025  
**Topic:** Complete Kubernetes deployment from local development to production

### **üìä Deployment Phases Summary:**

#### **Phase 1: Infrastructure & Network (SOLVED)**
- **Challenge**: Ingress-Nginx controller stuck in `ContainerCreating` due to network latency
- **Solution**: Pre-pull container images, use `--image` flag with Kind cluster

#### **Phase 2: Kubernetes Configuration (SOLVED)**
- **Challenge**: Backend pods stuck in `CreateContainerConfigError`
- **Solution**: Fixed secret key mismatches, used ConfigMaps for non-sensitive data

#### **Phase 3: Database Persistence (SOLVED)**
- **Challenge**: MySQL authentication failures due to stale data
- **Solution**: Complete reset of PV/PVC, deleted `/tmp/mysql-data`

#### **Phase 4: Health Probes (SOLVED)**
- **Challenge**: Backend readiness/liveness probes failing with 404
- **Solution**: Implemented proper `/health` endpoint

#### **Phase 5: WSL Filesystem Issues (SOLVED)**
- **Challenge**: WSL filesystem locks preventing cleanup
- **Solution**: Moved to production server deployment

#### **Phase 6: YAML Concatenation (SOLVED)**
- **Challenge**: YAML parsing errors when applying multiple files
- **Solution**: Applied files individually in dependency order

#### **Phase 7-8: PVC Binding Issues (SOLVED)**
- **Challenge**: PVC stuck in Pending due to `WaitForFirstConsumer` deadlock
- **Solution**: Fixed node affinity, created proper StorageClass and PV

#### **Phase 9: Init Container Circular Dependency (SOLVED)**
- **Challenge**: MySQL init container waiting for MySQL before it starts
- **Solution**: Removed problematic init container, used MySQL's built-in initialization

#### **Phase 10-13: MySQL Readiness Probe (SOLVED)**
- **Challenge**: Readiness probe failing with password authentication issues
- **Solution**: Fixed environment variable syntax (`$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` vs `$(MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD)`)

#### **Phase 14: Deployment Strategy (CURRENT)**
- **Challenge**: Backend/Frontend pods stuck due to `RollingUpdate` strategy
- **Solution**: Need to add `Recreate` strategy to prevent PVC conflicts

### **üîß Key Technical Solutions:**

#### **Environment Variable Syntax Fix:**
```yaml
# WRONG (Command substitution):
readinessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
    - mysql -h localhost -u root -p$(MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD) -e "SELECT 1"

# CORRECT (Variable expansion):
readinessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
    - sh
    - -c
    - mysql -h localhost -u root -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD -e "SELECT 1"
```

#### **Deployment Strategy Fix:**
```yaml
# Add to prevent PVC conflicts:
spec:
  strategy:
    type: Recreate  # Instead of RollingUpdate
  replicas: 1
```

#### **Storage Infrastructure:**
```yaml
# StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: local-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer

# PersistentVolume
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: local-storage
  local:
    path: /mnt/data
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
          - $(hostname)
```

### **üéØ Current Status (August 2, 2025):**

**‚úÖ WORKING COMPONENTS:**
- **MySQL**: `1/1` Running with proper service endpoints
- **Storage**: PVC bound successfully, data persistence working
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes cluster healthy

**‚ùå CURRENT ISSUES:**
- **Backend**: Old pod (25h) + new pod (18s) - both running, deadlock
- **Frontend**: Old pod (25h) + new pod (8s) - both running, deadlock
- **Root Cause**: Both deployments use `RollingUpdate` strategy instead of `Recreate`

### **üöÄ Final Fixes Needed:**

**1. Add `Recreate` Strategy to Backend:**
```yaml
# bookmynurse-devops/k8s/backend/deployment.yaml
spec:
  strategy:
    type: Recreate  # Add this line
  replicas: 1
```

**2. Add `Recreate` Strategy to Frontend:**
```yaml
# bookmynurse-devops/k8s/frontend/deployment.yaml
spec:
  strategy:
    type: Recreate  # Add this line
  replicas: 1
```

**3. Apply the Changes:**
```bash
# SSH to server
ssh -p 2244 root@103.91.186.102

# Apply the updated deployments
kubectl apply -f bookmynurse-devops/k8s/backend/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f bookmynurse-devops/k8s/frontend/deployment.yaml
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Infrastructure Planning

**Date:** July-August 2025  
**Topic:** Cloud migration strategies and AWS deployment options

### **üîÑ Self-Hosted vs Cloud Comparison:**

| Our Current Plan (Self-Hosted) | Enterprise Standard (Cloud) | Key Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A physical Linux server | **AWS (EC2), Azure (VMs), Google Cloud (Compute Engine)** | Instead of your own server, you rent virtual servers from a cloud provider. |
| `kubeadm` to install Kubernetes | **Managed Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE)** | The cloud provider manages the complex parts of Kubernetes for you. You get a ready-to-use cluster with the click of a button. |
| Ansible to provision the server | **Terraform or CloudFormation** | You use a tool like Terraform to define your *entire cloud infrastructure* (servers, networks, databases, load balancers) as code. |
| Local server storage | **Cloud Storage (EBS, Azure Disk, Google Persistent Disk)** | You use the cloud provider's highly reliable, network-attached storage instead of the server's local disk. |

### **üöÄ AWS Provider-Based Deployment:**

#### **1. Authentication and Access:**
- Instead of SSH keys and private IPs, you provide AWS credentials (typically an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) to your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., via GitHub Secrets).
- These credentials allow automation tools (like Ansible, Terraform, or the AWS CLI) to interact with AWS services over the internet using AWS APIs.

#### **2. Provisioning Infrastructure:**
- Tools like Ansible, Terraform, or AWS CloudFormation can use your AWS credentials to create, update, or destroy AWS resources (EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3 buckets, EKS clusters, etc.).
- For example, Terraform or Ansible modules can spin up EC2 instances, configure security groups, or deploy containers to ECS/EKS.

#### **3. Deployment Workflow:**
- Your GitHub Actions workflow would include steps to:
  - Install AWS CLI or relevant IaC tools.
  - Use the AWS credentials (from GitHub Secrets) to authenticate.
  - Run commands to provision infrastructure or deploy code (e.g., `aws ec2 run-instances`, `aws eks update-kubeconfig`, or `ansible-playbook` with AWS modules).
- No need for port forwarding or exposing SSH to the public internet, since all management is done via AWS APIs.

#### **4. Security:**
- AWS credentials should be stored securely (e.g., in GitHub Secrets).
- You can use IAM roles and policies to restrict what the credentials can do (least privilege principle).
- For even more security, you can use OpenID Connect (OIDC) to grant temporary credentials to GitHub Actions without storing long-lived secrets.

#### **5. Example Flow:**
- GitHub Actions runner authenticates to AWS using credentials from secrets.
- It provisions or updates infrastructure (e.g., launches EC2, updates EKS, etc.).
- It deploys your Docker images to AWS services (ECS, EKS, EC2, etc.).
- All communication is via secure AWS APIs, not direct SSH.

### **üìä AWS Deployment Options:**

| Service | OS Management Required | Package Management |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| AWS EC2 (vanilla Ubuntu) | Yes | Medium |
| AWS EKS (managed K8s) | No | None |
| AWS ECS/Fargate | No | None |

### **üéØ AWS Deployment Guidance:**

- **EC2:** You are responsible for all OS-level setup, just like on bare metal. Use the latest AMIs and keep your playbooks up to date.
- **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):** AWS manages the Kubernetes control plane and node setup. You do not need to add repos or keys for Kubernetes. You just deploy containers.
- **ECS/Fargate:** No OS-level package management. You deploy containers directly.
- **Best Practice:** Prefer managed services (EKS, ECS, Fargate) to avoid OS-level headaches and focus on your application.

### **üí° Career Value Statement:**

> *"I built a complete, production-style DevOps pipeline from scratch on a Linux server. This involved provisioning the Kubernetes cluster with Ansible, containerizing the applications with Docker, and building a full CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions. This entire architecture is directly transferable to a managed cloud environment like AWS EKS or Google GKE."*

This demonstrates a mastery of the fundamental principles that are in high demand across the industry.

## üîß DevOps Best Practices

### **üîÑ Traditional vs Modern DevOps:**

#### **Traditional Deployment (Current State):**
- Manual server setup and configuration
- Direct file uploads to server
- Apache/Nginx configuration files
- Manual database setup
- No version control for infrastructure
- Manual scaling and updates

#### **Modern DevOps Pipeline:**
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Ansible playbooks, Terraform/OpenTofu
- **Containerization**: Docker containers for all applications
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container management
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, logging, metrics
- **Security**: Secrets management, RBAC, network policies

### **üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components:**

#### **1. Docker (Containerization):**
- Frontend and backend applications packaged into lightweight, portable containers
- Ensures the application runs identically in any environment
- Example: Angular app in Nginx container, Node.js app in Node container

#### **2. Kubernetes (Orchestration):**
- Manages containers with automated deployments, scaling, self-healing
- Handles service discovery and load balancing
- Provides rolling updates with zero downtime

#### **3. Ansible (Infrastructure as Code):**
- Automatically provisions the production server
- Codifies server setup, making it repeatable, consistent, and version-controlled
- Handles OS-level configuration and package installation

#### **4. GitHub Actions (CI/CD):**
- Automatically tests, builds Docker images, and deploys new versions
- Provides zero-downtime deployments
- Integrates with infrastructure automation

#### **5. Nginx Ingress Controller (Traffic Management):**
- Replaces traditional Apache reverse proxy
- Acts as "smart traffic cop" for containerized applications
- Handles SSL termination and routing rules
- Configuration as code via YAML manifests

### **üîê Security Best Practices:**

#### **Secrets Management:**
- Store sensitive data (passwords, API keys) in Kubernetes secrets
- Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD pipeline credentials
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Rotate secrets regularly

#### **Network Security:**
- Use network policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
- Restrict access to Kubernetes API server

#### **Access Control:**
- Use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in Kubernetes
- Implement least privilege principle
- Use service accounts for application authentication
- Audit access logs regularly

### **üìà Scaling Strategies:**

#### **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):**
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: backend-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: backend-deployment
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

#### **Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA):**
- Automatically adjusts CPU and memory requests/limits
- Optimizes resource utilization
- Reduces waste and improves performance

### **üîç Monitoring and Observability:**

#### **Health Checks:**
- **Liveness Probes**: Detect if application is alive
- **Readiness Probes**: Detect if application is ready to serve traffic
- **Startup Probes**: Detect if application has started successfully

#### **Logging:**
- Centralized logging with ELK stack or similar
- Structured logging in JSON format
- Log aggregation and analysis

#### **Metrics:**
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Custom dashboards for application-specific metrics

### **üöÄ Deployment Strategies:**

#### **Rolling Update (Default):**
- Gradually replaces old pods with new ones
- Maintains availability during updates
- Can be configured with max surge and max unavailable

#### **Recreate:**
- Terminates all old pods before creating new ones
- Useful for stateful applications
- Ensures clean state but causes downtime

#### **Blue-Green:**
- Deploys new version alongside old version
- Switches traffic when new version is ready
- Enables instant rollback if issues arise

#### **Canary:**
- Deploys new version to small subset of users
- Gradually increases traffic to new version
- Allows testing in production with minimal risk

## üîß Technical Issues & Solutions

### **1. MySQL Pod Stuck in Pending**
**Symptom**: `kubectl get pods -n bookmynurse` showed MySQL pod as Pending
**Root Cause**: PVC namespace mismatch - PVC created in default namespace while deployment was in bookmynurse namespace
**Solution**: Added `namespace: bookmynurse` to the `k8s/mysql/pvc.yaml` file

### **2. Backend Pod in CrashLoopBackOff**
**Symptom**: Backend pod continuously restarting
**Root Cause**: Incorrect service name in DB_HOST environment variable
**Solution**: Changed DB_HOST from `mysql` to `mysql-service`

### **3. Frontend Pod in CrashLoopBackOff**
**Symptom**: Frontend pod continuously restarting
**Root Cause**: Incorrect backend service name in Nginx configuration
**Solution**: Updated proxy_pass directive in Nginx ConfigMap to `http://backend-service:3000`

### **4. ImagePullBackOff**
**Symptom**: Kubernetes couldn't pull Docker images
**Root Cause**: Cluster didn't trust local registry's self-signed certificate
**Solution**: Configured cluster to use local registry as mirror and added certificate to trust store

### **5. Health Probe Failures**
**Symptom**: Readiness and liveness probes failing with 404 errors
**Root Cause**: Missing `/health` endpoint in backend application
**Solution**: Implemented proper health check endpoints and configured probes correctly

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Migration Planning

### **Current Architecture vs AWS:**
| Current (Self-Hosted) | AWS Equivalent | Benefits |
|----------------------|----------------|----------|
| Physical Linux server | EC2 instances or EKS | Scalability, managed services |
| Manual Kubernetes setup | EKS (managed K8s) | Reduced operational overhead |
| Local storage | EBS volumes | High availability, backups |
| Manual networking | VPC, ALB, Route53 | Advanced networking features |

### **AWS Deployment Options:**

#### **Option 1: AWS EKS (Recommended)**
- **Managed Kubernetes**: AWS handles control plane management
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic node scaling based on demand
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer integration
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch and X-Ray integration

#### **Option 2: AWS ECS/Fargate**
- **Serverless**: No server management required
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for resources used
- **Simple**: Easier than Kubernetes for smaller applications

#### **Option 3: EC2 with Docker**
- **Full Control**: Complete control over infrastructure
- **Cost-effective**: For predictable workloads
- **Learning**: Good for understanding infrastructure

### **Migration Strategy:**
1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Use Terraform/OpenTofu for AWS resource provisioning
2. **Container Registry**: Migrate to Amazon ECR for Docker images
3. **Database**: Consider RDS for MySQL instead of containerized database
4. **Load Balancer**: Use Application Load Balancer for traffic management
5. **Monitoring**: Implement CloudWatch, X-Ray, and other AWS monitoring services

## üîß DevOps Best Practices

### **Infrastructure as Code:**
- **Terraform/OpenTofu**: Define all infrastructure as code
- **Version Control**: Store infrastructure code in Git
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable modules for different components
- **State Management**: Use remote state storage for team collaboration

### **Container Best Practices:**
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Optimize Docker image sizes
- **Security Scanning**: Scan images for vulnerabilities
- **Base Images**: Use official, minimal base images
- **Health Checks**: Implement proper health check endpoints

### **Kubernetes Best Practices:**
- **Resource Limits**: Set CPU and memory limits for all pods
- **Namespaces**: Use namespaces for organization and security
- **RBAC**: Implement proper role-based access control
- **Network Policies**: Restrict pod-to-pod communication

### **CI/CD Best Practices:**
- **Automated Testing**: Run tests before deployment
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Rollback Strategy**: Quick rollback capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Monitor deployments and application health

## üíº Interview Preparation

### **Key Talking Points:**

#### **Project Overview:**
"I successfully migrated a traditional Apache-based application to a modern, containerized architecture using Docker and Kubernetes. The project involved deploying a Node.js backend, Angular frontend, and MySQL database on a production Linux server with full automation and monitoring."

#### **Technical Challenges:**
"I encountered and resolved several complex issues including namespace conflicts, persistent storage binding problems, health probe failures, and image pull issues. Each problem required systematic debugging using kubectl commands and understanding of Kubernetes internals."

#### **Problem-Solving Approach:**
"I used a systematic approach to troubleshooting: first identifying the symptoms using kubectl get events and kubectl logs, then analyzing the root cause, and finally implementing targeted solutions. This approach helped me resolve issues efficiently and learn from each challenge."

#### **Results Achieved:**
"The final result was a robust, production-grade application with automated scaling, self-healing capabilities, and zero-downtime deployment potential. The application is now running successfully and can be easily scaled or migrated to cloud platforms."

#### **Learning Outcomes:**
"Through this project, I gained deep practical experience with Kubernetes, Docker, container orchestration, and modern DevOps practices. I learned the importance of Infrastructure as Code, proper monitoring, and systematic troubleshooting approaches."

### **Technical Questions to Expect:**

#### **Kubernetes Questions:**
- "How did you handle persistent storage for the MySQL database?"
- "What was your approach to troubleshooting pod failures?"
- "How did you configure health checks and probes?"

#### **Docker Questions:**
- "How did you optimize your Docker images?"
